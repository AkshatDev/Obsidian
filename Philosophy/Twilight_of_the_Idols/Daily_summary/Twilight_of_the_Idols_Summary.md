### MAXIMS AND ARROWS

**Idleness is the beginning of all psychology. What? Is psychology a vice?**

**Personal summary** - An empty mind starts to ponder over questions which an otherwise occupied mind would not. Could that be a reason why a person would start thinking psychologically? Does that mean a person in a higher state of mind (let's say a yogi or someone who is able to rid his mind of all the thoughts whenever he wants ) could certainly be a more psychological person?  Does this make psychology vice because to attain that state of control of mind, one has to sacrifice a lot?

**Even the most courageous among us only rarely has the courage to face what he already knows**

**Personal summary** Even the strongest person, the most righteous one does not have to courage (most of the times) to face their deepest darkest insecurities. To do that one has to accept the biggest truth of life i.e. "death".

**To live alone one must be a beast or a god, says Aristotle. Leaving out the third care: one must be both - a philosopher.**

**Personal Summary** I think this maxim only sounds good in reality its not good at all. Only a beast or a god could actually live alone, why? A beast does not choose to live alone but has to because no one want to be near one, a beast also does not understand why it has to live alone because it does not have the intellect. A god on the other hand, has to lead by example, has to sacrifice for others to be an example. A god has to show others the way to Nirvana, which is through sacrifice and isolation. A god is fully aware of the **why** of the suffering.

A philosopher is both a beast and a god because they might now that in order to attain Nirvana, they must sacrifice but sometimes they might question everything, which brings them to question the **why** as well.

**All truth is simple. Is that a double lie?**

This brings to the forefront the philosophical debate between absolute truths and relative truths. Some philosophical traditions assert that truths are universal, timeless, and unchanging, and in that sense, might be considered "simple." However, other schools of thought, particularly in postmodernist or constructivist frameworks, argue that truths are constructed through social, historical, and personal contexts, making them inherently complex and far from simple.

The maxim also touches on the problem of language and its capacity to convey truth. Can language, which is by its nature selective and interpretative, ever fully capture or express truth in its entirety, or does it always introduce some form of simplification or distortion?

**I want, once for all, not to know many things. Wisdom requires moderation in knowledge as in other things.**

**Personal Summary** It is better to be master of one rather than Jack of all. Being a deep thinker takes a lot of energy and attention to detail, it might be better to focus on topics of more importance rather than thinking about ever aspect if life so deeply that you are not able to enjoy it.
Having said these things, here are a few more points I'd like to make.

**Interdisciplinary Thinking**: While focusing deeply on one area, it's also beneficial to draw connections to other fields occasionally. This approach, known as interdisciplinary thinking, can enrich one's primary area of focus, providing innovative insights and solutions that pure specialization might miss.

**Adaptability**: In a rapidly changing world, it's also wise to remain somewhat adaptable, updating one's area of deep expertise as new information and technologies emerge. This ensures that one's deep knowledge remains relevant and practical.

In our own wild nature we find the best recreation from our un-nature, from our spirituality.

**Personal Summary** By engaging in more primal activities sometimes we can rejuvenate. We have come a long way from out primal selves , our wild nature. There are layers of culture, sophistication and socialism that we have developed over the years, on our wild primal nature. Sometimes it is the case that people try to find spirituality through giving up on different things that emit a sensation of satisfaction. It might be a good idea to sometimes engage in these primal activities like admiring nature, exploring simple yet complex and beautiful natural things around us to rejuvenate and not get burned out.
Value of simplicity -  Emphasizing  on the simplicity found in primal activities and underscore their relative powers.

Modern world does aim at making our lives more comfortable and liveable but it also brings in a lot of stress and takes thickens the wall between us and our wild nature.

**What? Is man merely a mistake of God's? Or God is merely a mistake of Man's?**

**Personal Summary** This is a perfect example of Nietzsche's more dialectical works. This maxim is open to a person's interpretation and then introspection.

I'll try to explore both ideas in somewhat detail.

Is man merely a mistake of God's is a satire on all the horrible atrocities committed by men over the ages. 
It is also assuming the fact that we do have free will and God is righteous, if it is all true then are we a mistake? Because no righteous person would allow this.

The second half assumes the opposite, did men create the idea of God to use it to have power over others? What we see today is people fighting over religion and countries being controlled with this the very idea of Religion and God. 

I partially agree with both halves. I think that there are higher powers and all living organisms have free will, I think that nothing is perfect and that is what makes us humans, even nature (the creator of life) is not perfect. But I refuse to accept the idea that we are mere mistakes of the divine. I believe every life has a meaning, it is also different for everyone, it changes as the situations around us change. A person can be what the divine wanted them to be, i.e. righteous, responsible and virtuous. In every challenge that we face in life, if we live by the rule that being righteous, responsible, virtuous and truthful we will have the best possible outcome, I believe then we can be what the divine intended us to be if not then it is us exercising our free will. Whatever actions, decisions we make, life makes sure we have to answer for them. I'll be open and say that these are my personal ideas and they are heavily influenced by [[Man's_Search_for_Meaning_Summary]]


**Out of life's school of war: What does not destroy me only makes me stronger.**

**Personal Summary** A lot of people think that life is about finding happiness but it is not. In life there are a few moments of happiness and the rest of life is full of sacrifices and hardships, the next catastrophe is always on the horizon. Keeping this in mind we should always approach these hardships with courage and righteousness if we do that then we only get stronger to face the next catastrophe and be a better person overall, it does us more harm then good if we choose to run away from the hardships of life, in the long run it could be devastating. 

One should also be careful about which battles to pick. This explanation does not by any chance mean that everything that happens around is a challenge and a battle to be fought.
