## Do you believe that there is a god?
Answer ->This is a question framed not correctly, 
Is belief your willingness to verbally ascent to the reality of the set of facts, that is what an empiricist or a rationalist say.

Does god exist the same way a table exists? NO.

There there are many other forms of belief, you can say one things and believe other, so do you believe what you say or do you believe what you do.

So what you do is a much more accurate marker of what you believe and what you say. 

## Do you love god with all your heart?

That is a hard stunt to pull off, none of us are unblemished vessels, so no. It does not mean I am not trying to.

## Forgiveness
 You can only forgive if you get to the bottom of it . you have to first understand it. Then swear it will never happen again.

If you are attempting to communicate and you are not being listened to, you are misperceiving the person the you are talking to and the situation you are in .

You are talking to someone other than the person who is there. One of the tinhgs you can do is STOP TALKING and start WATCHING LIKE A HAWK. Only then you will be able to assess the situation very well and know who is the person.


## Truth
Personal truth is in opposition to the God in proportion to the degree that that person is self-obsessed

The way you conceptualise yourself could be so broad that you truth could be more aligned that the "general truth"

# My belief -

## Do I believe in God?

To answer the above question, I want to define what belief and faith are?

### What is faith?
The decision to accept that the proposition that whatever happens in life, if you live by truth is by definition the best thing that can happen.

### What is belief?
Acceptance that certain ideas and propositions are true, sometimes even in absence evidence, having said that belief sometimes requires a hint of evidence or personal experiences.

### Defining my idea of 'God' -
God for me can be thought of your conscience. That voice or thought that tells you to be truthful even when you do not want to, the thought that tells you to be righteous when you do not want to, that thought that tells you that you are not doing the morally right thing.

I believe that ever person experiences this 'voice' to some extent. The extent to which people experience it might depend on how 'clean' of conscience they are trying to keep. How hard are they trying to fight for the meaning of life that is being responsible, righteous and virtuous.


So be the three definitions we have established, I can say that I am trying my best to believe in God and it is extremely to say that someone believes in God or not because it is not a right or wrong answer.
