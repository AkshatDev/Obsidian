**Rule 1. Never outshine the master**
Always make sure those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite - inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain heights of power.

Remember these 2 things - 
1. First, you can inadvertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. If you cannot help being charming and superior, you must learn to avoid such monsters of vanity.
2. Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want.
3. If your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to him, in as a public manner as possible. Make clear that *your* advice is merely an echo of *his* advice.
It is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity.

If your superior is a falling star,  there is nothing to fear from outshining him.

**Never put too much trust in friends, learn how to use enemies.**

**Rule 2. Never put too much faith in friends, learn how to use enemies.**
Be wary of friends - they betray you more quickly for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.

You often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things to avoid an argument.

Keep friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent.

A person who has something to prove will move mountains for you. 
Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens out wits, keeping us focused and alert.

Use enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing it as a struggle of good and evil.
