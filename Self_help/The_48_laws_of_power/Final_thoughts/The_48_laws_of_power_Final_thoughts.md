## Rule 1

**Never outshine the master**

While I do agree with this rule, there is (in my opinion) more knowledge that can be extracted from this rule.

Having this knowledge, if you are the Master, you can keep you ego in check and let your followers come to you with ideas and not punish them if they outshine you in the process but also be careful to not take disrespect, outshining someone and trying to put someone down are 2 different things.

## Never put too much faith in friends, learn how to use enemies.

If you think really hard about friendship, I wonder how many people have real friends. I believe people consider buddies as friends, and the Rule should be never trust your buddies. I am yet to formulate a proper definition of what 'friend' means.

You can only use enemies if they owe you something.
